## Setup

- Drop the mod in the mods folder

## Info

This mod changes the sorting order of the available resource packs list

- Uppercase and lowercase are sorted next to each other
- Formatting codes are ignored to reduce confusion

Custom resource pack names:

- Adds a new field `name` into the `pack.mcmeta` which overrides the display name for the resource pack
- Instead of showing `pack-name.zip` it shows `This is a custom name` using the custom styling as well
- Holding alt when hovering over a resource pack will show the original file name

```json
{
    "pack": {
        "pack_format": 8,
        "name": "\u00A72This is a custom name",
        "description": "\u00A73Custom description\nby MrMelon"
    }
}
```
